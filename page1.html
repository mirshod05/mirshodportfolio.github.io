            <h2>Class Projects</h2>
            <p>I have done a few class projects throughout my time at Wayne State. Here are some of them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a 3D printed Arduino-based DIY Centrifuge for my CAD class. This was a group project where we had to build
                    something that would be useful in the medical industry. My group and I built a centrifuge that can be used to spin samples with its 
                    base made from Siemens NX 3D printing, as well as Arduino code to get the motor spinning. You can see the images below.</li>
                <li>During my Web Technology class where I learned HTML and a little bit of JavaScript, we were asked to make a multi-page website
                    for any topic of our choosing as our final project. I made a webpage about my favorite soccer team, FC Barcelona. <a href="https://mirshod05.github.io/">
                        You can view it here.</a></li>
                <li>As part of an Honors Project for my Data Structures class, I got to work with grid computing. I created a matrix multiplication program and ran it
                    in the university's grid and execute it in parallel under different numbers of threads to observe the patterns between execution time and the number
                    of threads. <a href="misc/Honors_Project_Final.pdf">You can view the report here.</a></li>
